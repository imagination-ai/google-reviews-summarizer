There are many small coffee shops, many of them claim to serve specialty coffee. But at least in my opinion, this is only a label in order to charge a premium for pretty standard coffee. Saint Frank is different. You can discuss with the baristas there, they know their craft. You can chose from several beans, but I decided to go with a recommendation by the barista. My pour over was served with a small card describing the origin and the characteristics of the coffee I am about to enjoy. And I wasn't disappointed: the coffee was great, intense taste, very clean, fruity but not too much. Also the cappuccino my girlfriend had was good. A bit too much milk, but still good.
